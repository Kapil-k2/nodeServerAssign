# nodeServerAssign

This POC is to show that we can create our own server using Node without using any external server and we can handle the requests and response with our server.

## How to test

-Run node index.js

-Server will start at 3000 port (http://localhost:3000/).

-Test it with different urls and you will get response accordingly. It will work perfect for / and /index.html.
